## 👀 Reasoning in Image Generation

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored by LLMs and LMMs. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored.  In this project, we provide **T2I-R1**, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process.

We identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation:
1. 🧠 **Semantic-level CoT** is the **textual reasoning about the image to generate**, which is introduced prior to the image generation. The semantic-level CoT designs the **global structure** of the image, e.g., the appearance and location of each object.
   Optimizing the semantic-level CoT could explicitly manage the planning and reasoning of the prompt before the subsequent image tokens generation, making the generation easier.
   
3. 🎨 **Token-level CoT** is the intermediate patch-by-patch generation process of the image. Unlike semantic-level CoT, token-level CoT focuses on **low-level details** like pixel generation and maintaining visual coherence between adjacent patches. 
   Optimizing the token-level CoT can enhance both the generation quality and the alignment between the prompt and the resulting images.

To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce **BiCoT-GRPO** with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly **optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step**:

## 💪 Get Started
### Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaraJ7/T2I-R1.git
   cd T2I-R1
   ```

Create a conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n t2i-r1 python=3.10
   conda activate t2i-r1
   ```
   Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies.

   Install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
